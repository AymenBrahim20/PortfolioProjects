# Cleaning Data in SQL Queries

## Overview

The Cleaning Data in SQL Queries project focuses on utilizing SQL queries to clean and transform data within a SQL database. It includes essential SQL operations to enhance data quality and structure.

## Key SQL Operations

- **Data Formatting:** Utilize SQL functions like CONVERT() to change the format of date and time data.
- **Data Population:** Implement SQL JOIN operations to populate missing data based on relationships between tables.
- **Data Splitting:** Use SQL string manipulation functions such as SUBSTRING() and CHARINDEX() to divide text data into separate components.
- **Data Modification:** Employ SQL UPDATE statements to modify existing data, such as updating values or applying conditional transformations.
- **Data Deduplication:** Apply SQL techniques like ROW_NUMBER() and DELETE statements to remove duplicate records from tables.
- **Data Restructuring:** Utilize SQL ALTER TABLE statements to add or remove columns from tables to optimize data structure.

## Usage

1. **Execute SQL Queries:** Run the provided SQL queries on your database to perform data cleaning and transformation tasks.
2. **Review Results:** Evaluate the updated data to ensure that the cleaning operations were successful and meet the desired data quality standards.


## Data Derived from Excel
